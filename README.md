# Music-genre-classification-with-the-Million-Song-Dataset

In this project I explore different topics in Deep Learning (such as network architecture, sequential modelling or model combination) to predict the genre of a song with The Million Song Dataset.

The project has been developed as coursework for the course Machine Learning Practical at the University of Edinburgh (http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/index-2016.html). The data and a data provider to access the Million Song Dataset data have been provided by the teaching staff (more details in report.pdf).

The repository contains, in the Coursework folder, a report of the experiments undertaken in the coursework (report.pdf) as well as the implementation of these experiments (up to sequential modelling). The implementation of the experiments for Model Combination and the Correcting Model could be uploaded on request. Furthermore, in the Bayesian Deep Learning folder, I am starting to explore the use of a Bayesian approach for the weights of the last layer of the model.
